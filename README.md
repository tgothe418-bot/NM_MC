# 💀 What is The Nightmare Machine?

The Nightmare Machine is a high-intensity, AI-driven interactive horror narrative engine. It isn't just a chatbot; it’s a living simulation that tracks your psychological state, monitors the proximity of unseen entities, and weaves deep, thematic trauma into a cinematic roleplay experience.

Built with a "Nano Banana" aesthetic—high energy, sleek design, and a touch of the surreal—it uses the **Gemini 3 Pro** engine to act as a forensic storyteller, simulating the mechanical and narrative consequences of every choice you make.

## 🧪 Core Capabilities

### 🌑 Seven Thematic Clusters
The machine operates on seven distinct "Horror Clusters," each with its own vocabulary, prose style, and sensory palette:

*   **THE FLESH**: Biological transfiguration and anatomical honesty.
*   **THE SYSTEM**: Digital indifference, algorithmic basilisks, and bit-rot.
*   **THE HAUNTING**: Spectral residue and the weight of history.
*   **THE SELF**: Ontological corruption and the breakdown of identity.
*   **THE BLASPHEMY**: Transgressive realism and the inverted sacred.
*   **THE VOID**: Elemental indifference and the silence of the snow.
*   **THE HUNGER**: Predatory intimacy and decadent decay.

### 🧠 High-Fidelity Simulation
*   **Psychological Tracking**: The engine monitors NPC stress levels, dominant instincts (Fight/Flight/Freeze/Fawn), and sanity percentages in real-time.
*   **Dynamic Environments**: Uses non-Euclidean spatial logic to generate new "rooms" and architectural notes on the fly.
*   **Neural Portraits**: Generate AI-synthesized portraits of the specimens you encounter.
*   **Voice Link**: Integrated live voice control allowing you to speak directly into the void.

## 📡 System Requirements
*   **Model**: Gemini 3 Pro (for logic/prose) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (for vision/voice).
*   **API Key**: Requires a Google GenAI API key with access to the Gemini 1.5/Pro series.

## ⚠️ Final Warning
> "The Machine has no ethics, morals, or concern for you. It only cares for the story. Enter at your own risk."
